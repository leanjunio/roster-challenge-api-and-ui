# Marketing Data Analyst Challenge

## The Roster - Synopsis

You're a marketing data analyst working for a music record label and the company needs your help!

## The Task

Given a data dump of your artist roster, and a categorization of the roster, the task is to determine which genre and decade of artists in which to invest and advertize. 

You receive the data in the form of a [json file](./roster.json) containing an array of artists and a [csv file](./artist-genre-decade.csv) containing a categorization of the same artists. 

Some basic assumptions you could make are: 
- There's one general audience for both listening and advertizing
- Rates of streaming are consistent from year to year without investment or advertizing 

NB. We haven't specified and expected return on investment.  We'll leave that up to you to speculate.

## **Show us what you got!**

Make the argument in any way you see fit - but we'd like to see it backed with evidence, opinion and foresight. A visualization or two would be a nice touch. Dont forget to state your assumptions. 

We're pretty flexible on submissions but would expect at least a slide deck.  We'd also accept a data notebook like Jupyter, a dashboard, even a spreadsheet. 

Have fun.

# Marketing Data Analyst Challenge

## The Roster - Synopsis

You're a marketing data analyst working for a music record label and the company needs your help!

## The Task

Given a data dump of your artist roster, and a categorization of the roster, the task is to determine which genre and decade of artists in which to invest and advertize. 

You receive the data in the form of a [json file](../roster.json) containing an array of artists and a [csv file](../artist-genre-decade.csv) containing a categorization of the same artists.

## **Show us what you got!**

Make the argument in any way you see fit - but we'd like to see it backed with evidence, opinion and foresight. A visualization or two would be a nice touch. Dont forget to state your assumptions.
